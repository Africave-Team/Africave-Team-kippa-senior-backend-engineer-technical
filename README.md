# kippa-senior-backend-engineer-technical
This repository houses the technical interview test for a senior backend engineer @ Kippa


# Overview

This technical test allows you to choose between two projects. Read more about it below. 


## Project 1

Background: 
Kippa is a bookkeeping software system, so in this project you will be building out a very minimal system following the microservice architecture.

- Service(s) to handle the business logic ( It is up to you to decide what the business logic is & the extent of this logic and yes it is totally fine to split these services if you choose, TIP: look at the current Kippa App to get ideas. https://kippa.africa/download?)
- An authentication service ( of course there should be authentication , don't you think? 🙂)
- A notification service ( oh well, you see, our users have to know what's up, when it's up right? 🤜🤛🏾)
- ..... and any other service of choice! ( .. I mean, we trust you Ninja!🥷🏾)

It's really up to you to choose your technologies of choice when building this, but it will super uber better if you stayed with the technologies listed in the job description

We care a lot about documentation, well tested code, a very thought out design pattern, an extendable code, and of course a code that works! 

This is a microservice , so we would really like to see how you manage things like data sharing, latency, communication across services, log management....  I mean you know the chops! 

Bonus tip: 
A deployed project bangs too🚀🚀

  
## Project 2

Okay maybe we understimated your ninja skills🥷🏾, so the second project is totally up to you! Sweet right? 
Maybe you have something better to show us (... we really do hope so 🙂), we want you to tell us what you to build instead. 

Please send an email with Subject Name: ### Kippa Senior Backend Engineer Technical Challenge (Project Choice)

Then clearly communicate the project you'd like to build or what you intend to do. Sweet right?😀
